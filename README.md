### Homework:

```text
משימת בית:
שימוש בספריית Faker, לייצר 100 אובייקטים של צ'אט, נגיד 20 קבוצות ו80 פרטי.
להשתמש בListview.builder ולהציג את כל השיחות

המלצות להוספת קושי 😁:
מיינו את התוצאות של הצ'אט לפי התאריכים (מתודת SORT על המערך)
נסו להחליף את השעה בTRAILING ב"אתמול" או בתאריך (צרו פורמטר חדש מספריית INTL)

### HomeWork Aug, 8th:

Using Faker generate 100 TEXT msgs;

Build the chat page UI:

App bar with the name, photo/avater/first Letter and appBar actions

Listview.builder but without using the ListTile

Note: Some of the msgs should "be sent" by `me`, styling should be as showed in the video!!!

To make the triangles on the sides you need to use [ClipPath]

- Extra - Add the TextField at the bottom

### HomeWork Aug, 14th:

  1. In the `MessageTile` widget, fix the width of the tile to be a min of 40% and a max of 75% of the screen width, depending on the `message` length.
  2. Try implementing the `ChatInput` widget with all the buttons and text fields.
  3. Show sender name if not sent by me

### HomeWork Aug, 22th:

  1. Try to build the database schema for the chat app, use `drawio` right here in VSCODE.
  2. Read about `freezed`; A video was sent earlier today.
  3. Read what is document DB, and `firestore`.
  4. Try to convert your schema to `firestore` collections and documents.
